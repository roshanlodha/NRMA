Since the Hungarian Algorithm and its variants rely on a square matrix as input, we use an artificially inflated penalty that approaches infinity in the limit (arbitrarily large) to ensure that a given student is not assigned to the same rotation twice rather than deleting the rotation from the student's preference.

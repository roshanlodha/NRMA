# Automating Clerkship Matching Using "Bean Assignment" and Linear Sum Optimization
## Introduction
description of problem
## Methods
1. reframing question as a maximum cost problem
2. sourcing optimal costs and "beans" method 
3. matrix setup + linear sum optmization (scipy)
4. custom error metrics
## Results
source from Alan and Tori
## Discussion
1. summary/key findings
2. discussion of optimality and completeness
3. future endeavors including skew cost with cost modifying functions
